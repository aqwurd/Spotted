# Spotted
An iOS app written in Swift. 

Early versions of this application will let users track all aircraft or automobiles that they have spotted, along with which airports they have been to (for the plane nerds). 
Possibilities for further categories include: movies, landmarks, countries/cities! Feel free to suggest some features.
